## Phone Triage Client

Site built to help users fix problems with their phone.
The app consists of a forum of problems and solutions as well as a mechanism to request a tech meet you to fix your phone.

### Forum & Service Request

The user is first shown a page with common problem types. From here they click on the problem they are experiencing to see different sub sections of the problem. If one of these fits what the user is experiencing, they can click on it to see if there are any solutions posted for this particular problem. The user can also post a new problem of their own or post a solution to an existing problem. The user may also request a service technician meet them to fix their phone if they are unable to fix it themselves.
